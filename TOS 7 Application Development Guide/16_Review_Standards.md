# 16. Review Standards

### 16.0 Submission Automated Validation (Pre-filter)

**Trigger Timing:** Executed in real time after a new version is submitted on the Developer Platform with the package uploaded / repository linked. Validation failure results in immediate blocking; no review ticket is generated and no initial review is entered.

**Validation Coverage:**

#### config.ini Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Valid JSON syntax (no comments, no trailing commas, no single quotes outside double quotes) | Validate using `python3 -m json.tool` | 8.4 config.ini Specification |
| No single quotes, no inline comments | JSON standard only allows double quotes; `//` or `/* */` are treated as comments | 8.4 config.ini Specification |
| All required fields present (id/version/system_id/package/platform/type/name/icon/path, etc.) | Check against the required fields checklist item by item | 8.4.3 Key Rules |
| type and open_path are mutually exclusive (both cannot exist) | Docker apps use the `type` field, Deb apps use the `open_path` field | 8.4.2 Field Reference |
| path field must use `${ip}` placeholder; no hardcoded IP or domain | All URL-type path must be written as `https://${ip}:port/` | 8.4.3 Key Rules |
| version / system_id / package version numbers are consistent | version numbers in config.ini, DEBIAN/control (or Docker compose tag), and app.lang must be unified | 4.2 Version Number Specification |
| platform field matches the actual submitted package architecture | e.g., if platform declares `x86_64`, binaries in the package must be x86_64 architecture | 8.4.2 Field Reference |

#### app.lang Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| All 14 language nodes present (keys complete) | Missing any language node results in immediate blocking | 8.5 app.lang Specification |
| name / descript fields non-empty for all languages | Empty fields must be filled with English translations; blank strings not allowed | 8.5.3 Field Descriptions |
| File encoding is UTF-8 without BOM | EF BB BF bytes not allowed at file header | 8.5.5 File Encoding & Format |
| All line endings must be LF (\\n); CRLF (\\r\\n) prohibited | A common cross-platform collaboration issue; Windows developers must pay extra attention | 4.6 Cross-Platform Line Ending Specification |

#### Resource File Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Icon format is SVG | PNG/JPG/ICO or other bitmap formats are not accepted | 8.6 Application Icons |
| SVG has transparent background, valid viewBox | viewBox attribute must exist with reasonable values | 8.6 Application Icons |
| Icon file path exactly matches the `icon` field in config.ini | Including case sensitivity and directory hierarchy | 8.6 Application Icons |
| All script files (.sh/.py/.pl) must not use CRLF line endings | Unified LF line endings | 4.6 Cross-Platform Line Ending Specification |

#### Package Structure Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Dual-package data package (data.tar.gz) must not contain binary executable files (except lifecycle scripts such as postinst/preinst under the DEBIAN directory) | Business programs and runtime binaries must not appear in the data package | 8.17 Dual-Package Mode Specification |
| Directory name case compliance (all lowercase, consistent with config.ini declarations) | Linux file system is case-sensitive | 8.2 Common Directory Structure |

#### Dependency Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Docker app `depend` field must include `DockerEngine` | Without it, the Docker environment cannot be guaranteed ready at install time | 5.2 Declaring Runtime Dependencies |

#### Version Rule Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Version number must be strictly greater than the last published version (e.g., 1.0.1 > 1.0.0) | Version rollback or duplicate submission is prohibited | 4.2 Version Number Specification |
| Version number must not contain informal suffixes such as `beta` / `alpha` / `rc` | Pre-release identifiers must be removed for official publication versions | 4.2 Version Number Specification |

#### Hash Validation

| Check Item | Description | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| The SHA-256 of the uploaded package must exactly match the declared sha256 at submission | Prevents transmission corruption or tampering | 8.15 Packaging & Checksums |

**Result Notification:** Automated validation failure only shows a popup with error description and documentation link; no review ticket is generated. Developers fix and resubmit, which re-triggers automated validation. Only after all checks pass can the process proceed to the 16.2 Manual Review workflow.

### 16.1 Four Review Dimensions

| Dimension | Review Content | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|
| **Configuration Completeness** | config.ini correct JSON format, app.lang with all 14 languages, SVG-compliant icon, no missing required fields, valid systemd service file | Dedicated Review Staff |
| **Functional Availability** | Install/start/stop/uninstall complete without errors, correct architecture adaptation, functionality matches description, ports available without conflicts | Testing Support Staff |

### 16.2 Review Workflow

#### 16.2.1 Initial Review Phase
1. Dedicated review staff log into the Application Management Platform (https://mgmt.terra-master.com) and claim "Pending Initial Review" tasks
2. Download the application package under review, obtain the baseline SHA-256 hash, and record it
3. Verify information consistency: the application information submitted by the developer matches the content of the GitHub/Gitee repository
4. Verify repository compliance: repository is public, directory structure is complete, no redundant or prohibited files
5. Intellectual property compliance check: no infringement of TerraMaster or third-party intellectual property

**Initial Review Results:**
- ✅ Passed → Application status updated to "Pending Manual Review", enters the manual review phase
- ❌ Rejected → Detailed rejection reasons provided; developer notified through both channels for correction

#### 16.2.2 Hash Value Flow Verification
All review staff must first verify that the hash value matches the baseline hash value before beginning their review work. If the hash value is abnormal, immediately pause and investigate.

#### 16.2.3 Manual Review Phase
Proceed in the following order:
1. **Technical Support Staff** → Security Review (security scanning, code security, network security, data compliance)
2. **Testing Support Staff** → Functionality & Compatibility Review (install/start/stop/uninstall testing, architecture adaptation, functional completeness)
3. **Dedicated Review Staff** → Compliance & Content Review, User Experience & Documentation Quality Review

Each position provides a clear review opinion (approve/reject with specific reasons). The Dedicated Review Staff consolidates the results into a comprehensive review outcome.

### 16.3 Scoring Standards

| Dimension | Weight | Max Score | Minimum Passing Score | One-Vote Veto Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Configuration Completeness | 30% | 30 | 27 | Missing required fields, JSON syntax errors |
| Functional Availability | 35% | 35 | 28 | Cannot install/start/stop |
| Security | 25% | 25 | 20 | Running as root, privileged mode, malicious code |
| Compliance | 10% | 10 | 8 | Intellectual property infringement, illegal content |

#### Detailed Deduction Rules

**Configuration Completeness (max 30 points):**
- Missing 1 required field: deduct 5 points
- config.ini JSON syntax error (comments, trailing commas, single quotes): directly deduct to 0 points (equivalent to one-vote veto)
- app.lang missing 1 language node: deduct 3 points
- app.lang with empty fields (name or descript empty): deduct 3 points per language
- SVG icon format non-compliant (non-SVG / no viewBox / non-transparent background): deduct 5 points
- systemd missing security parameters (ProtectSystem / NoNewPrivileges): deduct 2 points per missing item
- Multiple defects accumulate deductions until score reaches 0

**Functional Availability (max 35 points):**
- Non-fatal warnings during installation: deduct 3 points
- Startup time exceeding 10 seconds: deduct 2 points
- Residual processes after stop: deduct 5 points
- Residual files or service after uninstall: deduct 5 points
- Single-architecture adaptation failure (either x86_64 or aarch64 unavailable): deduct 10 points
- Functional description mismatch with reality (1 item): deduct 5 points, cumulative
- Multiple defects accumulate deductions until score reaches 0

**Security (max 25 points):**
- System user UID in 0–999 range but not root: deduct 3 points
- ProtectSystem not configured: deduct 5 points
- NoNewPrivileges not configured: deduct 3 points

- Third-party open source code used without license declaration: deduct 3 points
- app.lang description exaggerated or inconsistent with functionality: deduct 3 points
- Multiple defects accumulate deductions until score reaches 0

**Beta Application Score Relaxation Rules:**
- Beta version apps have minimum passing scores uniformly reduced by 5% (i.e., each dimension's minimum score × 0.95)
- One-vote veto items still apply to Beta apps, not reduced
- The Beta identifier must be set via the `"beta": true` field in config.ini; **do not add suffixes such as `-beta`, `-rc`, or `-alpha` to the version number.**

**Comprehensive Judgment Rules:**
- Any dimension score below that dimension's minimum passing score → Rejected
- Total score below 85 (out of 100) but all dimensions meet minimums → Conditional pass, with an attached list of improvement suggestions; developer should address in the next version
- Any "One-Vote Veto Item" triggered → Immediate rejection; no score calculation needed

**One-Vote Veto Items (any single item triggers immediate rejection; no further review needed):**
- Application runs as root user
- Docker app uses privileged mode (`--privileged`)
- Docker app uses `network_mode: host` (container network isolation violation)
- Malicious code or data theft behavior detected
- Application ID duplicates an existing application
- **Data package (`<appid>.deb`) contains binary executable files** (except lifecycle scripts postinst/preinst/postrm/prerm under the `DEBIAN/` directory)
- Checksum mismatch
- Any language in app.lang has empty `name` or `descript` field
- config.ini uses single quotes or contains inline comments
- Submitted package architecture does not match the `platform` field in config.ini

### 16.5 Rejection Correction Process

1. Review not passed → System notifies developer through dual channels: "Platform Message + Registered Email"
2. Developer logs into the Developer Platform to view rejection reasons and correction suggestions
3. Developer must fix the issues and resubmit within **30 days**
4. No resubmission after 30 days → Submission is automatically closed
5. Consecutive **3 automated validation failures** or **manual review rejections** both count toward the rejection count; after 3 consecutive rejections, the platform automatically generates a **Customer Service Consultation Ticket** (not a review ticket), with a technical specialist providing one-on-one assistance for corrections
6. **After successfully correcting and submitting a new version, the consecutive rejection count is automatically reset**: Once the developer completes corrections, submits a new version, and passes review, the historical rejection count resets to zero and is no longer accumulated
7. Resubmit after corrections → Update the version number and re-enter the review workflow under the new version

**Permanent Restriction Terms:**

Under any of the following circumstances, the platform will **permanently close** the developer's application submission channel:
- Multiple submissions of malicious applications (containing viruses, trojans, cryptocurrency miners, ransomware, etc.)
- Multiple submissions of applications infringing third-party intellectual property rights
- Verified reports of data theft, backdoors, or other severe security violations
- Evasion or falsification of review materials (fake repositories, forged checksums, impersonation of others' identities, etc.)

Permanent restriction is an irreversible penalty. The platform will send a formal notification via email with supporting evidence. Developers may submit an appeal application through the platform's appeal channel within 15 business days.

### 16.6 Review Timelines

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Automated Validation | Real-time | Completed instantly upon submission |
| Initial Review | 1–2 business days | Information consistency and repository compliance verification |
| Manual Review | 3–5 business days | Comprehensive security/functionality/compliance review |
| Publication & Listing | 1–2 business days | Listed in App Center after approval |

> The total review cycle is typically 5–8 business days. Initial review results from submission are usually available within 1–2 business days; you can check progress in real time on the Developer Platform. Peak periods may cause delays; please plan your submission timing accordingly.
